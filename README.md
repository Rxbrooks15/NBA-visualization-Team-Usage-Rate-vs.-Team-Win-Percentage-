Founded in 2017, Dartmouth Sports Analytics (DSA) is a student-run organization purposed with providing students exposure to and experience with sports analytic concepts, methodologies, and research.
Dartmouth Sports Analytics intends to equip members with necessary skills for success in the modern world. It is our hope that every member will leave this club with a strong base in statistics as well as coding and scraping abilities that, preparing them for the multifaceted challenges they will face in their professional careers.

The project developed through a few steps:
1. In September 2021 I in a group of 9 Discussed how teams differ on whether they have several players contributing to points or one key player that scores the points.
2. We looked at the variance of a team's usage rate and compared it with their win percentage.
3. 3.We then collaboratively linked NBA Team Win Percentage to Team Usage Rate Variance, which revealed a strong correlation of 0.66 and a multiple R-squared value of 0.43. Produced t-test results that reaffirmed a statistically significant relationship where increased usage of one or two talented star players trumps holistic team usage of five average players
